[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I started my geology degree with the intention of studying volcanoes. However, minerals, and in particular carbonate minerals, crossed my path. Since then, my scientific interest has always been linked to the study of these minerals. During my thesis (UCM), I studied the formation of carbonates with structures analogous to dolomite and the reactivity of the dolomite surface in contact with solutions supersaturated in other mineral phases. In my first postdoc (UPM), I studied how calcite and dolomite particles could be used in foliar fertilisation of plants. During my second postdoc (IACT, CSIC-UGR), I studied, using computational mineralogy techniques, the structure of norsethite. Currently, during my third postdoctoral contract (ISTerre, UGA-CNRS), I am studying how sulphate carbonation reactions occur. This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 101021894 [CARS-CO2].\nAlthough during all this time my curiosity has led me to research about several topics: the surfaces of other minerals (halite, kyanite), of synthetic materials (graphene and organic crystals) and even of plants (rose petals); chemobrionics; and the structure of other minerals using computational mineralogy methods.\n\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://cpimentelguerra.com/chemobrionics/author/carlos-pimentel/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/chemobrionics/author/carlos-pimentel/","section":"authors","summary":"I started my geology degree with the intention of studying volcanoes.
